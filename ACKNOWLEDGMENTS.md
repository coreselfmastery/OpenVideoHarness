# Acknowledgments · 致谢

OpenVideoHarness is a harness, not a renderer. It stands on the frameworks, research, open-source skills and publicly shared experiments listed below. Thank you to every author. Unless marked *vendored*, nothing here is redistributed: `references/fetch.sh` fetches each repository from its original source into `references/repos/`, which is git-ignored. Each work keeps its own license.

This project is independent. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic, HeyGen, Remotion, Show Lab (NUS), or any author listed here. Product and model names (Claude, Claude Code, Codex, Seedance, etc.) belong to their owners.

**License scope.** The MIT license in [LICENSE](LICENSE) covers this repository's original content. Third-party components keep their own licenses:
- `engines/ClaudeAnimationBase` is (c) John Heibel, MIT License (see `engines/ClaudeAnimationBase/LICENSE`).
- `recipes/` holds 24 files modified from Apache-2.0 material: 21 from video-shotcraft (Copyright 2026 Wei Yihao) and 3 from HyperFrames (Copyright 2026 HeyGen, Inc.). The upstream parts stay under Apache-2.0 and our changes are MIT. Both upstream licences are in `recipes/LICENSES/`, each of these files says it was modified and names the upstream files and commit, and `recipes/NOTICE.md` lists them all (Apache-2.0 §4).
- `playbook/12-ideation.md` §3 has a Chinese rewrite of parts of HyperFrames' `skills/hyperframes/references/pitch-round.md` (commit `a46095f`; Apache-2.0, Copyright 2026 HeyGen, Inc.). That part stays under Apache-2.0; the licence copy is `recipes/LICENSES/Apache-2.0-hyperframes.txt`.
- Repositories fetched by `references/fetch.sh` into `references/repos/` are NOT part of this distribution; each is governed by its own license (listed below).

## Vendored (shipped in this repository)

| Component | Author | License | Where / how it is used |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ClaudeAnimationBase](https://github.com/JohnHeibel/ClaudeAnimationBase) | John Heibel | MIT | `engines/ClaudeAnimationBase/`: the hand-painted p5.js + p5.brush engine, its `ANIMATION_GUIDE.md` and renderer. Copied unmodified; `.git` and build output are not included. Its "reads" timing method, review loop and failure list shaped `playbook/01-pipeline.md`, `playbook/02-verification.md` and `templates/TASTE_CHECKLIST.md`. |

**Frameworks and skills**

| Repository | Author | License | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) (skills only) | HeyGen | Apache-2.0 | Primary HTML/GSAP engine; motion-doctrine, caption aesthetics, style presets and CLI verification.

The divergence step in `playbook/12-ideation.md` §3 (four questions, a rough probability per idea, the silhouette check) is translated and rewritten from its pitch round (`skills/hyperframes/references/pitch-round.md`, same commit) |

## Toolchain

[Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) (Apache-2.0, default local voice via [mlx-audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio), MIT), [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org) (code-composed music and SFX), [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) (timestamped contact sheets), [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev), [p5.js](https://p5js.org), [p5.brush](https://github.com/acamposuribe/p5.brush), [GSAP](https://gsap.com), [Three.js](https://threejs.org) (MIT, the intro film's 3D world), [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev), [Manim Community](https://www.manim.community), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp), [FunASR](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR), [librosa](https://librosa.org), [beat_this](https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this), [Demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs), and the other projects in `references/open-source.md`.

## Data we point to (not shipped)

- [Make Me a Hanzi](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi) by Shaunak Kishore (skishore): stroke-order data for Chinese characters, described in `video-types/07-hand-drawn.md`. It is neither vendored nor fetched: `graphics.txt` is under the Arphic Public License and `dictionary.txt` under the LGPL, so each project downloads the characters it needs and records them in its asset ledger.

## Community creators

Public experiments and generously shared prompts from these creators shaped the case studies and prompt templates. We link to them; we do not redistribute their media.

- **deckard (@slimer48484)**: the song *Claude-Pop – I'm Upping My P(Doom)*.
- **John Heibel (@other__reality)**: PDoomVideo and ClaudeAnimationBase.
- **donald jewkes (@donaldjewkes)**: the Claude Pop prompt, and the idea of rotoscoping over generated footage.
- **@pleometric**, **mexicat (@_mexicat)** and **YC (@yucheng)**: remixes and the Chinese version that showed video-as-code can be forked.
- **@eudaemonea** and **Joshua Ledbetter**: *Functional Emotions*.
- **viggo (@decohack)**, **@achxvi** and **@ajith_io**: the one-line "showreel" prompt lineage.
- **Andy L (@AndyL5cc)**: one-sentence science explainers (*Interstellar* black hole, the Marquis Yi bells).
- **@kimmonismus**, **@pradeepXkapoor**, **@jake11moran**, **@dotey (宝玉)**, **@AxtonLiu** and **@goodside**: prompts analysed in `cases/community-prompts.md`.
- **Movez (@0xMovez)**: the 12-step course *How to build motion design studio with Opus 5.5*, through which the techniques of **Tony Dinh**, **@oozn** and **@mablesjoseph** reached `cases/community-prompts.md`.
- **Eian (@EianLu)**: a Chinese guide to making motion videos with Opus 5.5 and two films, *AGENT/0* and *华夏·五千年*: a code-composed score used as the script, and chapter titles written in true stroke order.
- **Winter (@WinterArc2125)**: *Austerlitz, 2 December 1805*, with its full source.
- **AnctyEnly453**: *抽象代数：结构之美* ([abstract-algebra-promo](https://github.com/AnctyEnly453/abstract-algebra-promo)), a 4:23 Canvas/WebGL promo with its full source: a bar-based scene table, sub-frame motion blur that never crosses a cut, math data computed and asserted by script, and a bus-mixed procedural score. It has no LICENSE, so we read it and do not fetch it (`cases/opus55-gallery.md` §7).
- **xilo (周行; @xilo2991, GitHub Kianzzz)**: a long Chinese article on making videos with Opus 5.5, and the [xilo-opus-video](https://github.com/Kianzzz/xilo-opus-video) skill (MIT), whose four spring registers are listed in `playbook/03-motion-design.md` §1 and whose green-screen keying steps shaped the pattern in `playbook/05-hybrid-genvideo.md`. Its environment check, which launches a real headless browser, probes WebGL2 and gives install hints per OS, is the model for the WebGL probe and the OS-aware hints in `bin/vh doctor`.
- **Adrian Punk (@AdrianPunk115)**: the two-part *AI 视频运镜词典* (X, 2026-09-27/28). Its method for writing camera moves that a video model can execute is summarised in `playbook/05-hybrid-genvideo.md` ("给视频模型写运镜"), with a link back: four layers, start → path → end → constraints, a trigger between two moves, and at most two main moves per short clip. The text stays the author's; we quote no prompts.
- **Gorden Sun (@Gorden_Sun)**: a dance clip generated by Grok on a green screen and finished by Opus 5.5 in code, the example behind the green-screen pattern in `playbook/05-hybrid-genvideo.md`.
- **Chris Tyson (The Agent Architect)**: Claude Code + Remotion production lessons.
- **Jason Zhu (@GoSailGlobal)** and **余温 (@gkxspace)**: curating and surfacing the community skill list; Jason Zhu also for the 962-work Opus 5.5 catalogue (jasonzhu.ai) behind `cases/opus55-gallery.md` §5.
- **yihui-dev** and **huangserva (@servasyy_ai)**: collecting and surfacing 389 Opus 5.5 videos with their prompts.
